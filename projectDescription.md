# Project Description

This project is a react app  which is created to register details of Students.This form stores the name,phone number, email id and branch of that student.This data of students is stored using firebase firestore. The data is stored in the firestore in the form of a collection named with their starting name and branch combined. The data is stored in the form of documents in the collection.Ihave used React-Hook-Form to validate the fields in making the form.This form is fully responsive and I have also done the bonus task.
